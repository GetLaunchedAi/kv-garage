      <h2 class="cs-title">Refunds — KV Garage</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        We want you to be confident buying from KV Garage. Refunds are handled as follows:
      </p>
      
      <div class="policy-item">
        <h3>Before Fulfillment (Pre-shipment)</h3>
        <p>Full refunds available on request within 48 hours of payment.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="policy-item">
        <h3>After We Purchase / Before Shipping</h3>
        <p>If an item was a preorder tied to a supplier/pallet and we have already paid the supplier, we will offer either (a) a full refund minus any non-refundable supplier/transaction fees, or (b) a swap to a different pack of equal or greater value. We will notify you immediately if this applies.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="policy-item">
        <h3>After Shipping / Delivery</h3>
        <p>Refunds for delivered items are only issued in case of major misrepresentation (items materially different than described) and must be reported within 7 days of delivery with photos. In those cases we will either (a) accept return and refund, or (b) offer an equal-or-better replacement. Return shipping for buyer-initiated returns is the buyer's responsibility unless we agree otherwise.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="contact-info">
        <p><strong>To request a refund:</strong> Email <a href="mailto:support@kvgarage.com">support@kvgarage.com</a> with your order number and photos (if applicable). We will respond within 24 hours.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2 class="cs-title">Swap / Inventory Assurance (2X Swap Program)</h2>
      <h3 class="section-subtitle">2X Swap Program — KV Garage</h3>
      <p class="cs-text">
        We stand behind the resale value of our packs. If you do not generate at least 2X your pack spend (e.g., $500 → $1,000) within 60 days from the delivery date, we will provide a one-time inventory swap of equal or greater retail value, subject to these rules:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="policy-list">
        <li>You must provide evidence of attempted resale (2 sample listings OR 30 days of documented effort across marketplaces). We require reasonable proof to qualify for a swap.</li>
        <li>Swaps are valid once per pack purchase and must be requested within 60 days of delivery.</li>
        <li>Swapped inventory will be of equal or greater estimated resale value; we may substitute SKUs to ensure sellability.</li>
        <li>This program is not intended to cover buyer inaction or marketplaces that are temporarily down — it protects against genuinely unsellable or misrepresented inventory.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="contact-info">
        <p><strong>To request a swap:</strong> Email <a href="mailto:swaps@kvgarage.com">swaps@kvgarage.com</a> with your order number, links/screenshots showing resale attempts, and a short description of your actions. We typically resolve swap requests within 72 hours.</p>

      <ul class="policy-list">
        <li><strong>No blind pallets.</strong> We curate and assemble packs from known SKUs — buyers get predictable mixes (cases/cables/protectors) unless a pack is explicitly labeled "auction contingent."</li>
        <li><strong>Clear ROI math.</strong> Every pack listing includes sample resale estimates so you can evaluate profit potential.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality checks.</strong> We inspect sample units and conduct basic QC. For larger orders we can arrange third-party inspections (additional fee).</li>
        <li><strong>Fast communication.</strong> We reply to support requests within 24 hours on business days.</li>
        <li><strong>Local pickup option.</strong> When available we offer local pickup so you don't pay shipping.</li>

      <div class="policy-item">
        <h3>Pre-Order (Auction Contingent) listings clearly state:</h3>
        <p>"This pack is a pre-order for an upcoming lot. A deposit of X% reserves priority allocation. If we fail to secure the lot or content that differs materially, you will be offered a full refund, an equal-value swap, or store credit."</p>
      </div>
      
      <ul class="policy-list">
        <li>We never hide supplier manifests; upon request we will share proof of sourcing or photos of received stock.</li>

        <li><strong>CAN-SPAM / email:</strong> always include a way to unsubscribe in email and the business contact information. Use only lists you have permission to contact if sending mass emails.</li>
        <li><strong>SMS:</strong> include opt-out text: "Reply STOP to opt out." Keep SMS short and transactional. Only text numbers you have a business reason to contact.</li>
        <li><strong>Platform rules:</strong> don't mass-spam DMs on Instagram/Facebook — personalize messages to avoid bans.</li>
