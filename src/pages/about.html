      <p class="cs-text">
        Kv Garage is a community-driven liquidation business built on
        transparency, value, and helping resellers succeed. We source
        hand-picked liquidation pallets, mobile accessories, and tech deals
        to help entrepreneurs turn inventory into income.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        What sets us apart? We combine local advantage with nationwide reach,
        offering verified inventory and exclusive discounts for resellers.
        Our founder's journey from Boy Scout popcorn sales to million-dollar
        monthly revenue drives our commitment to community growth and success.

          I'm a 21-year-old entrepreneur who got hooked on reselling in 3rd grade
          as the top-selling Boy Scout popcorn seller. At 18, I joined a home
          improvement marketer and helped drive over a million dollars in monthly
          sales. Today, I run three businesses: liquidation supply chain, index
          investing, and consulting small business owners.
